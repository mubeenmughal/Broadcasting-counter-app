// Answer: 

/*
State management in React refers to how data is handled within components to determine
their behavior. In simpler terms, it's about keeping track of information (state)
and updating it as needed.


Different ways to manage complex application state in React include:

Local Component State: Each component can manage its own state using the useState hook. 
This is suitable for managing simple data within a single component.

Context API: The Context API allows sharing state across multiple components without passing props manually.
 It's useful for managing shared data across the component tree.

Redux: Redux is a library for managing application state in a predictable and centralized way. 
It's suitable for large-scale applications with complex state requirements.
